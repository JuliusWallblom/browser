# React rules

## Component types

- UI components: highly reusable components (like "button" or "text"), these should go in "src/components/ui"
- Core components: reusable components, independent of module/feature (like "header" or "table")
- Module components: components that are specifically made for a feature (module)

## Important rules when working with components

- Always use absolute imports if possible
- Never use React.FC or "FC"
- Never use React.useState, make sure useState is imported directly
- Always create functional components
- Always make sure you split up the components into multiple components
- If something can be optimized by using memo or callback, use it
- Avoid using useEffect unless absolutely necessary
- Unless it's returning a specific value, always write functions instead of arrow functions
