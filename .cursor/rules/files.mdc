# File rules

## When to use kebab-case

- Components
- Screens
- Pages
- Constants
- Hooks

## When to use camelCase

- Utils

## Code splitting

You are expected to separate components, constants, hooks and utils from one another

## When to create barrel files

- Barrel files should never be created for "util" (utility) or "hook" directories
- If there is only one file in the directory, that file itself should be called index.ts or index.tsx. If there are more than one file, a barrel file should be used

## How to name components

- We should NEVER include the word "component" in component names
- If a component resides within a module, the name of the component should start with "module name"-. An example of this is "settings-cell.tsx" inside of the settings module's components directory
