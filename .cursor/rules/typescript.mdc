# TypeScript rules

Only write TypeScript, no JavaScript. Make sure that all linting errors are fixed and that we follow TypeScript best practices. That includes but isn't limited to:

- We type everything
- We NEVER use "any"
- Reuse types, don't unneccesarily create new types
- If one type has a data object that is part of another type, such as "stationName" being the object "name" of type "Station", make sure you use it accordingly, e.g. "stationName: Station["name"]"
- Never cast types like "as Type"
